# Halloween-2016-Workshop

For a workshop I ran at NYU in their new makerspace for Halloween 2016. 
Using EVA foam and other materails and tools. 
I would recommend using 3/8" sheets of EVA. 
Didn't experiment so much with Acrylic paint which seems to be the one that is popular for EVA foam painting. 
Semisphere should be printed in 1.25" diamater in a transparent/transclucent color filament.
